  title     = "A Decision Model for Data Sharing",
  booktitle = "Electronic Government",

  abstract  = "Data-driven innovation has great potential for the development
               of innovative services that not only have economic value, but
               that help to address societal challenges. Many of these
               challenges can only be addressed by data sharing of public and
               privately owned data. These public-private data sharing
               collaborations require data governance rules. Data governance
               can address many barriers, for example by deploying a decision
               model to guide choices regarding data sharing resulting in
               interventions supported by a data sharing platform. Based on a
               literature review of data governance and three use cases for
               data sharing in the logistics sector, we have developed a data
               sharing decision model from the perspective of a data provider.
               The decision model addresses technical as well as ownership,
               privacy, and economical barriers to sharing publicly and
               privately owned data and subsequently proposes interventions to
               address these barriers. We found that the decision model is
               useful for identifying and addressing data sharing barriers as
               it is applicable to amongst others privacy and commercial
               sensitive data.",

  abstract    = "Current research on prosocial behavior covers a broad and
                 diverse range of phenomena. We argue that this large research
                 literature can be best organized and understood from a
                 multilevel perspective. We identify three levels of analysis
                 of prosocial behavior: (a) the ``meso'' level--the study of
                 helper-recipient dyads in the context of a specific situation;
                 (b) the micro level--the study of the origins of prosocial
                 tendencies and the sources of variation in these tendencies;
                 and (c) the macro level--the study of prosocial actions that
                 occur within the context of groups and large organizations. We
                 present research at each level and discuss similarities and
                 differences across levels. Finally, we consider ways in which
                 theory and research at these three levels of analysis might be
                 combined in future intra- and interdisciplinary research on
                 prosocial behavior.",

              been derived. The results suggest that a conceptually simplistic
              view is often adopted with regard to open data, which
              automatically correlates the publicizing of data with use and
              benefits. Also, five ``myths'' concerning open data are
              presented, which place the expectations within a realistic
              perspective. Further, the recommendation is provided that such
